                                <p>Meal prepping is a fantastic way to ensure you eat healthy, balanced meals even when
                                life gets busy.
                                For beginners, it may seem overwhelming, but with a few simple steps, you can make
                                it an easy and sustainable habit. <br>
                                Eating healthy is one of the most important steps you can take to improve your
                                overall well-being. A nutritious diet fuels
                                your body, supports your immune system, boosts energy, and helps prevent chronic
                                diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

                                where to start. This guide breaks down the basics to help you make smarter choices and maintain a balanced diet.</p>
                                <h3>Why Meal Prep?</h3>

                                    <li><span class="bold">1. Start Small:</span> Begin by prepping 2-3 meals per week, you dont need to plan every
                                    meal immediately, pick lunch or dinner and gradually build up.</li>
                                    <li><span class="bold">2. Versatile Ingredients:</span> Use ingredients like roasted veggies,

                                    <li><span class="bold">3. Invest in Storage Containers:</span> Proper storage is key for keeping meals fresh.Opt for reusable containers

                                    <li><span class="bold"> 4. Prep in Bulk:</span> Cook large batches of staples like brown rice, quinoa, roasted vegetables,
                                     and proteins. You can then mix and match these ingredients to create different meals.</li>
                                     <li><span class="bold">5. Set Aside Time:</span> Dedicate a few hours one day a week like Sunday to cook and portion out your meals.

                                <h2>Why Hydration Matters</h2>
                                <p>Your body is made up of about 60% water, and it uses fluids to perform vital
                                    functions such as transporting nutrients, maintaining organ function, and
                                    eliminating waste.
                                    Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, poor concentration, and even more
                                    serious health issues.Ensuring you're properly hydrated helps you feel your best both physically and
                                    mentally. Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining overall health, but it’s about more than just drinking water.
                                    While water is essential, there are other ways to keep your body hydrated and avoid dehydration, especially if you're busy, active, or live
                                    in a hot climate.Hydration plays a key role in regulating body temperature, supporting digestion,improving mental clarity, and keeping your skin healthy.</p>
                                <h3>Beyond Water: Other Sources of Hydration</h3>
                                <p>Eat Hydrating Foods Many fruits and vegetables have high water content, which
                                    contributes to your daily hydration needs. Some excellent hydrating foods include:
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Cucumbers (95% water)
                                    <br>Watermelon (92% water)
                                    <br>Strawberries (91% water)
                                    <br>Lettuce (95% water)
                                    <br>Celery (95% water)
                                </p>
                                <p> These foods not only add variety to your diet but also provide essential vitamins,
                                    minerals, and fiber while keeping you hydrated.
                                    <br>Drink Herbal Teas and Infused Water Herbal teas (like peppermint or chamomile)
                                    and fruit-infused water are great alternatives to plain water.
                                    <br>These drinks are refreshing and can add flavor without added sugars or caffeine,
                                    making it easier to stay hydrated throughout the day.
                                    <br>Coconut Water Coconut water is a natural source of electrolytes such as
                                    potassium and magnesium, which are essential for maintaining fluid balance. It’s a
                                    great hydrating option after exercise or on hot days, helping replenish lost
                                    electrolytes more effectively than plain water.
