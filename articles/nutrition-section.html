                            <h2>Meal Prepping for Beginners:</h2>
                            <p>Meal prepping is a fantastic way to ensure you eat healthy, balanced meals even when
                                life gets busy.
                                For beginners, it may seem overwhelming, but with a few simple steps, you can make
                                it an easy and sustainable habit.
                                <br>Eating healthy is one of the most important steps you can take to improve your
                                overall well-being. A nutritious diet fuels your body, supports your immune system,
                                boosts energy, and helps prevent chronic
                                diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.However, with so much conflicting
                                information out there, it can be hard to know
                                where to start. This guide breaks down the basics to help you make smarter choices and
                                maintain a balanced diet.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Why Meal Prep?</h3>
                            <p>Meal prepping helps save time during the week, reduces stress around cooking, and ensures
                                you have healthy meals readily available.
                                It is also budget-friendly since it cuts down on impulse purchases and takeout.
                                Most importantly,meal prepping gives you more control over the nutrition of your 
                                 meals,helping you maintain a balanced diet.
                            </p>
                            <p> Start by planning your meals for the week, focusing on simple, nutrient-dense recipes
                                that include a balance of protein, healthy fats,
                                and high-fiber carbohydrates. Choose dishes that store well and can be eaten throughout
                                the week.Examples include grain bowls, salads, stir-fries, and soups.

                            <h2>Why Hydration Matters</h2>
                            <p>Your body is made up of about 60% water, and it uses fluids to perform vital
                                functions such as transporting nutrients, maintaining organ function, and eliminating
                                waste.
                                Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, poor concentration, and even more serious
                                health issues.
                                Ensuring you're properly hydrated helps you feel your best both physically and mentally.
                                Staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining overall health, but it’s about more than
                                just drinking water.
                                While water is essential, there are other ways to keep your body hydrated and avoid
                                dehydration, especially if you're busy, active, or live
                                in a hot climate.Hydration plays a key role in regulating body temperature, supporting
                                digestion,improving mental clarity, and keeping your skin healthy.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Beyond Water: Other Sources of Hydration</h3>
                            <p>Eat Hydrating Foods Many fruits and vegetables have high water content, which
                                contributes to your daily hydration needs.
                                <br>Some excellent hydrating foods include:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <span class="bold">Cucumbers (95% water)</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="bold">Watermelon (92% water)</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="bold">Strawberries (91% water)</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="bold">Lettuce (95% water)</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span class="bold">Celery (95% water)</span>
                            </p>

                            <p> These foods not only add variety to your diet but also provide essential vitamins,
                                minerals, and fiber while keeping you hydrated.
                                <br>Drink Herbal Teas and Infused Water Herbal teas (like peppermint or chamomile)
                                and fruit-infused water are great alternatives to plain water.
                                <br>These drinks are refreshing and can add flavor without added sugars or caffeine,
                                making it easier to stay hydrated throughout the day.
                                <br>Coconut Water Coconut water is a natural source of electrolytes such as
                                potassium and magnesium, which are essential for maintaining fluid balance. It’s a
                                great hydrating option after exercise or on hot days, helping replenish lost
                                electrolytes more effectively than plain water.
